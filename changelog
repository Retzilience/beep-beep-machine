Problem: The original code disabled text selection for all elements on the page using the user-select: none property. This prevented interaction with form elements like input fields on desktop.
Solution: We added a media query to apply the user-select: none property only on mobile devices. This allows interaction with form elements on desktop while still preventing text selection on mobile devices.
Problem: The number input box for BPM had up and down arrows that allowed users to change the value by clicking.
Solution: We added CSS code to remove the up and down arrows from the number input box. This allows users to change the value by typing only.
These changes improved the usability of the metronome by allowing users to interact with form elements on desktop and providing a cleaner interface for changing BPM values.
