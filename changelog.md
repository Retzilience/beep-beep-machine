## [2.01] - 2023-03-10
### Added
- Added a media query to apply the `user-select: none` property only on mobile devices. This allows interaction with form elements on desktop while still preventing text selection on mobile devices.

### Changed
- Changed CSS code to remove the up and down arrows from the number input box. This allows users to change the BPM value by typing only.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where text selection was disabled for all elements on the page, preventing interaction with form elements like input fields on desktop.

These changes improved the usability of the metronome by allowing users to interact with form elements on desktop and providing a cleaner interface for changing BPM values.
